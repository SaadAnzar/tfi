const courageessay = `During my B.ed internship, my responsibility was teaching social science to classes VII and VIII and English to class VII. My task was to manage classes and develop and implement comprehensive lesson plans. I was always ambitious about teaching and learning new things. So, I developed new ways of teaching through creative means by using technology to enhance student learning - making ppts and videos for online classes. I also have the responsibility of developing and implementing comprehensive lesson plans and conducting different research studies for my subjects. I was getting familiar with the school environment and started getting enjoyment out of all the school activities and improving my overall conduct in all the classes. To motivate my students I engage them with different activities like the inclusion of maps, word games, etc. Finally recapitulating regularly with students was a good point in conducting an effective class. During the start of my B.ed internship, I faced a problem with the management of classes. But as time passes by I learn how to understand the needs of students as well as take care of the discipline. I started by applying some ground rules and reinforcing them by repeating and reminding them as and when required. The students started to recognize the rules and start abiding by them. Also , engaging the students with creative activities will help to motivate them and foster a positive learning environment. Engaging them with activities like puzzle solving , word building , creating interests in them through various ppts, and videos . Also havin g student centric classrooms and having discussions on various topics had a positive influence and helped to solve the above problem effectively.`

const clessay = `a. I have a positive mindset and a keenness of learning continuously, therefore I was able to grasp new concepts and create engaging lesson plans and activities to make the students more motivated toward learning. I am dedicated to my work with a passion for helping students to reach their full potential. b. Initially, I had a problem managing time with various activities but as I become more familiar with the classes I was able to divide the time fruitfully in creating lesson plans, teaching aids, and delivering the classes. c. This was because I did not have any prior experience of working under such pressure but as time passes by I started enjoying all this and therefore I was able to manage the time more effectively and doing my tasks more effeciently.`

const purposeessay = `As my mother was a teacher of social sciences in a govt. school for 34 years, I think I've witnessed education for the underprivileged up close. I'm aware of the challenges (both sociological and economical) that children of these communities face.

Therefore, in my opinion, an excellent education goes beyond academics, encompassing holistic development, critical thinking, creativity, and empathy. As a Teach for India fellow, my two-year goals for students are multifaceted. Firstly, I will focus on building their confidence and self-esteem, encouraging a growth mindset by recognizing and celebrating their achievements, big and small. Secondly, I will strive for academic excellence by using innovative teaching methods, tailored to diverse learning styles, and providing individual attention. Thirdly, I'll try to foster a personal connect with the students, helping them out in problems in all aspects of life, not just studies. This is something I've seen my mother do with her students, which has ultimately helped them the most to overcome their personal challenges as well.

Moreover, I will actively engage parents and the community to create a strong support system for students. Regular parent-teacher meetings, workshops, and community events will facilitate this collaboration. Additionally, I will implement continuous assessment, providing constructive feedback to students, identifying their strengths, and addressing areas for improvement. Data-driven insights will inform my teaching strategies, ensuring personalized attention.

As I mentioned earlier, being the child of a govt. school teacher, I've witnessed the socio-economic challenges that hinders the underprivileged from attaining education, which in my opinion should be a fundamental right for every human being. Furthermore, I am deeply driven to join the Teach for India Fellowship and be a part of the movement to end educational inequity because I firmly believe that education is a powerful catalyst for social change and empowerment. Witnessing the stark disparities in educational opportunities among underprivileged communities has fueled my determination to make a meaningful impact on the lives of these young minds.

By joining this Fellowship, I will have the opportunity to work directly with students who face significant socio-economic challenges and lack access to quality education. Being a teacher in these communities will enable me to bridge the gap and empower students with the knowledge, skills, and confidence they need to break the cycle of poverty and achieve their full potential.

What excites me about the two-year program is the immersive and transformative experience it offers. The Fellowship provides an intensive platform to develop my teaching abilities, leadership skills, and understanding of educational issues. This fellowship would also provide me the platform to give back to the community and help drive a positive change in people's lives.

Moreover, the program's focus on personal growth and continuous learning aligns with my belief in lifelong learning and growth mindset. The opportunity to witness the positive impact of my efforts on my students and the community will be immensely rewarding, encouraging me to push my boundaries further.

Overall, the Teach for India Fellowship provides the perfect platform for me to channel my passion for education, tackle educational inequity head-on, and contribute to a brighter and more equitable future for the children and communities I serve.`
